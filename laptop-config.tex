\chapter{Laptop Configuration}
\section{DNS}
DNS is configured for the entire \texttt{8.0.0.0/24} block and \texttt
{2020:b012::/32} block using the \texttt{.group2} domain. The two DNS servers:
\texttt{ns1.group2} and \texttt{ns2.group2} are arranged to provide redundancy.
\texttt{ns1} is hosted on \texttt{laptop-1} and operates as the master
nameserver. \texttt{ns2} is configured as a slave to the \texttt{ns1} master.
Appendix~\ref{appendix:bind9} contains the configuration files used to
configure the DNS software, Bind9. The three zone files found in Listings~\ref
{listing:master-dns-db-group2},~\ref{listing:master-dns-db-12} and~\ref
{listing:master-dns-db-2020-b012} provide forward DNS resolution for
IPv4 and IPv6, reverse DNS resolution for IPv4 and reverse DNS resolution for
IPv6 respectively. The six devices on the network each have a single canonical
name, as well as potentially useful alternative names provided as CNAME records.
For example, the laptop connected to the router \texttt{alpha.group2} has the
canonical name of \texttt{laptop-1.group2}, as well as a CNAME record for
\texttt{tftp.group2}.
