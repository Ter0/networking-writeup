\section{DNS}
DNS is configured for the entire \texttt{8.0.0.0/24} block using the 
\texttt{.group2} domain. The three DNS servers: \texttt{ns1.group2}, \texttt
{ns2.group2} and \texttt{ns3.group2} are arranged to provide redundancy. \texttt
{ns1} is hosted on the laptop connected to \texttt{Alpha} and operates as the
master nameserver. \texttt{ns2} and \texttt{ns3} are configured as slaves to the
\texttt{ns1} master.
